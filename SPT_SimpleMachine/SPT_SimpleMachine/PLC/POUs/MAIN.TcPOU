	This example is the smallest possible implementation of the the framework. 
	By calling the CyclicLogic of Machine everything inside the framework that is needed to control the statemachine and log the existing events is being processed.
	
	The HMIPermissions method is required to allow the Visu to control the state machine through the PackMLBaseModule_HMI structure.
	
	All libraries in this project are pinned at V3.9.x
	While only the SPT Base Types library is used, the others are provided for your convenience.
